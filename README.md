# Go/No-Go Cognitive Game: Airplane Direction Challenge

## Overview

Welcome to the Go/No-Go Cognitive Game: Airplane Direction Challenge! This project is an implementation of the classic cognitive science task known as the Go/No-Go task, adapted into an engaging game format. The game is designed to test and improve cognitive control and decision-making skills.

## How the Game Works

In this game, players are presented with a series of airplane images. The goal is to make quick decisions based on the direction of the airplanes:

- **Go Trials**: In these trials, players must choose the correct direction for the airplane by pressing the appropriate key.
- **No-Go Trials**: In these trials, players must refrain from making any response when they hear a beep sound.

The game challenges players to focus and respond accurately while ignoring irrelevant stimuli, which is central to cognitive science research on attention and control.

## Customization Options

The game is highly customizable to fit different experimental needs and preferences:


- **Number of Go Trials per Block**: Define how many Go trials are included in each block of the game.
- **Number of No-Go Trials per Block**: Set the number of No-Go trials that will be present in each block.
- **Fixation Time**: Adjust the short time during which a fixation point is displayed before showing the airplane.
- **Show Time**: Set the duration for which the airplane is visible during each trial.
- **Stop Signal Delay**: Configure the delay between the appearance of a beep sound and the end of the No-Go trial.
- **Valid Directions**: Specify the valid directions for each airplane and distractor.
- **Color Customization**: Change the colors of the airplanes and distractors to fit your experimental design.
- **Shape Customization**: Modify the shapes of the airplanes and distractors for varied visual stimuli.

## how to use
You can download the game from the `gonogo` folder. Use the `input` file to set the game parameters, then provide the address of the saved file to start the game. After completion, output information will be saved in the `output` folder.
